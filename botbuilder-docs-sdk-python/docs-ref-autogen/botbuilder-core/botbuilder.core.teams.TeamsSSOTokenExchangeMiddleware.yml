summary: 'If the activity name is signin/tokenExchange, self middleware will attempt
  to

  exchange the token, and deduplicate the incoming call, ensuring only one

  exchange request is processed.'

  parameters:
  - name: storage

remarks: 'If a user is signed into multiple Teams clients, the Bot could receive a

  "signin/tokenExchange" from each client. Each token exchange request for a

  specific user login will have an identical Activity.Value.Id.


  Only one of these token exchange requests should be processed by the bot.

  The others return <see cref="System.Net.HttpStatusCode.PreconditionFailed"/>.

  For a distributed bot in production, self requires a distributed storage

  ensuring only one token exchange is processed. self middleware supports

  CosmosDb storage found in Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Azure, or MemoryStorage for

  local development. IStorage''s ETag implementation for token exchange activity

  deduplication.
