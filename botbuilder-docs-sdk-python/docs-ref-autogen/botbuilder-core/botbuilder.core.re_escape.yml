  summary: 'Escape special characters in a string.


    This is a copy of the re.escape function in Python 3.8.  This was done

    because the 3.6.x version didn''t escape in the same way and handling

    bot names with regex characters in it would fail in TurnContext.remove_mention_text

    without escaping the text.'
