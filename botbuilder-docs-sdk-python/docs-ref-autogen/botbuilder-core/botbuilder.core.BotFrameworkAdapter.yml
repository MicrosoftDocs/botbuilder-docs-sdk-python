summary: Defines an adapter to connect a bot to a service endpoint.
constructor:
  syntax: 'BotFrameworkAdapter(settings: botbuilder.core.bot_framework_adapter.BotFrameworkAdapterSettings)'
remarks: 'The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends activities
  to and

  receives activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your bot receives an activity,

  the adapter creates a context object, passes it to your bot''s application logic,
  and

  sends responses back to the user''s channel.

  The adapter processes and directs incoming activities in through the bot middleware

  pipeline to your bot''s logic and then back out again.

  As each activity flows in and out of the bot, each piece of middleware can inspect
  or act

  upon the activity, both before and after the bot logic runs.
