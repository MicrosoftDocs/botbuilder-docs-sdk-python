summary: 'When added, this middleware will send typing activities back to the user

  is received to let them know that the bot has received the message and is working
  on the response.

  You can specify a delay before the first typing activity is sent and then a frequency,
  which

  determines how often another typing activity is sent. Typing activities will continue
  to be sent

  until your bot sends another message back to the user.'
