summary: "Base tests that all storage providers should implement in their own tests.\n\
  They handle the storage-based assertions, internally.\n\n\nAll tests return true\
  \ if assertions pass to indicate that the code ran to completion, passing internal\
  \ assertions.\nTherefore, all tests using theses static tests should strictly check\
  \ that the method returns true.\n\n\nNote: Python cannot have dicts with properties\
  \ with a None value like other SDKs can have properties with null values.\n    \
  \  Because of this, StoreItem tests have \"e_tag: *\" where the tests in the other\
  \ SDKs do not.\n      This has also caused us to comment out some parts of these\
  \ tests where we assert that \"e_tag\"\n      is None for the same reason. A null\
  \ e_tag should work just like a * e_tag when writing,\n      as far as the storage\
  \ adapters are concerened, so this shouldn't cause issues.\n\n\n\n:Example:\n  \
  \  async def test_handle_null_keys_when_reading(self):\n        await reset()\n\n\
  \n        test_ran = await StorageBaseTests.handle_null_keys_when_reading(get_storage())\n\
  \n\n        assert test_ran"
