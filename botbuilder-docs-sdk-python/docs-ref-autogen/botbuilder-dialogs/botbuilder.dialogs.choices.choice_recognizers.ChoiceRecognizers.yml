    their choice by index (they can say \u201Cone\u201D to pick *choice[0]*) or ordinal\
    \ position\n\n   (they can say \u201Cthe second one\u201D to pick *choice[1]*.)\n\
    \nThe user\u2019s utterance is recognized in the following order:\n\n* By name\
    \ using *find_choices()* \n\n* By 1\u2019s based ordinal position. \n\n* By 1\u2019\
    s based index position. \n\nutterance: The input.\n\nchoices: The list of choices.\n\
