    \n   (they can say \"the second one\" to pick *choice[1]*.)\n\nThe user's utterance\
    \ is recognized in the following order:\n\n* By name using *find_choices()* \n\
    \n* By 1's based ordinal position. \n\n* By 1's based index position. \n\n# Parameters:\n\
    \nutterance: The input.\n\nchoices: The list of choices.\n\noptions: (Optional)\
    \ Options to control the recognition strategy.\n\n# Returns:\n\nA list of found\
    \ choices, sorted by most relevant first."
